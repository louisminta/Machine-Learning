# Machine-Learning Projects
This repository contains my machine learning projects developed using JupyterLite and Python. Each notebook showcases a different aspect of machine learning-from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation.
## Projects Included
- Machine Learning: Brief description of what the notebook does.
- Example: Predicting housing prices using linear regression.

## Getting Started
To view the notebooks:
1. Download the '.ipynb' files.
2. Open them locally in Jupyter Notebook or use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) for a quick preview.
## Requirements
Basic Python libraries used in these projects include:
- 'pandas'
- 'numpy'
- 'matplotlib'
- 'scikit-learn'
